# NAME

rebuilderd.conf - *rebuilderd* and *rebuildctl* configuration files

# SYNOPSIS

/etc/rebuilderd.conf

~/.config/rebuilderd.conf

# DESCRIPTION

This file contains configuration for both rebuilderd and rebuildctl.

# OPTIONS

## [http]

_bind_addr=_
	The address to bind to. This is 127.0.0.1:8484 by default.

_endpoint=_
	Set a default endpoint for rebuildctl. This is especially useful for the
	sync timer. Defaults to *http://127.0.0.1:8484*.

## [auth]

_cookie=_
	A random cookie to authenticate administrators. If this value is not set
	rebuilderd is going to generate one on it's own and write it to
	*/var/lib/rebuilderd/auth-cookie*. You only need to configure this if you
	want to administrate remotely.

## [endpoints."https://rebuilder.example.com"]

_cookie=_
	This section is usually only configured in *~/.config/rebuilderd.conf*. It
	allows setting cookies for alternative rebuilderd instances with *-H*. The
	value passed by *-H* need to match the section header exactly, make sure
	there's no trailing slashes.

## [worker]

_authorized_workers=_
	Whitelist public key of *rebuilderd-worker* instances. See the
	authentication section in *rebuilderd*(1) for details.

_signup_secret=_
	Configure a shared secret that a *rebuilderd-worker* must provide to be
	allowed to join. See the authentication section in *rebuilderd*(1) for
	details.

## [schedule]

_retry_delay_base=_
	Configure the delay to automatically retry failed rebuilds in hours. The
	default is 24h, this base is multiplied with the number of rebuilds, so the
	first retry would happen after 24h, the second retry would happen 48h after the
	first retry and the third retry would happen 72h after the second retry. There
	is no upper limit of retries, if you can't afford frequent retries it's
	recommended to set this to a high value like 168 (1 week) or higher.
	Successful rebuilds are not retried.

# EXAMPLE

```
## Configuration for http daemon
#[http]
## The address to bind to. This is 127.0.0.1:8484 by default.
#bind_addr = "0.0.0.0:8484"
## Set a default endpoint for rebuildctl. This is especially useful for the sync timer.
#endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8484"

## A random cookie for administration is generated at startup and written to /var/lib/rebuilderd/auth-cookie
## You can set this to a fixed value here. Use `pwgen -1s 32` to generate one.
## rebuildctl is searching for this cookie in ~/.config/rebuilderd.conf, /etc/rebuilderd.conf and
## /var/lib/rebuilderd/auth-cookie in that order.
#[auth]
#cookie = "INSECURE"

## The auth cookie above is only used for the default endpoint.
## You can use different endpoints with `rebuildctl -H https://rebuilder.example.com status`,
## In that case you need to configure a section below if you want to attach a cookie.
#[endpoints."https://rebuilder.example.com"]
#cookie = "INSECURE"

## IMPORTANT: in production, make sure either `authorized_workers` or `signup_secret` is configured.
#[worker]
## If we have a fixed set of workers we can whitelist the keys here.
#authorized_workers = ["key1", "key2"]
## If we want to spawn new workers dynamically we can configure a sign up secret below.
## Use `pwgen -1s 32` to generate one.
#signup_secret = "INSECURE"

#[schedule]
## Configure the delay to automatically retry failed rebuilds in hours. The
## default is 24h, this base is multiplied with the number of rebuilds, so the
## first retry would happen after 24h, the second retry would happen 48h after the
## first retry and the third retry would happen 72h after the second retry. There
## is no upper limit of retries, if you can't afford frequent retries it's
## recommended to set this to a high value like 168 (1 week) or higher.
## Successful rebuilds are not retried.
#retry_delay_base = 24
